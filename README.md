# file_to_base64_url
Convert local files to Base64 data URLs

index_contained.html :
---
an example showing how the css/js script dependencies can themselves be encoded and used, so that the entire application continues working once encoded without much effort

index_smallest.html :
---
a simplified and minified version that can encode itself and then be ran as a data url, which i find very absurd and fun :) (tested/working in firefox 119, possibly more)
